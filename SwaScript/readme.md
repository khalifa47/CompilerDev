# SwahiliScript Compiler

SwahiliScript is a simple programming language designed for educational purposes, based on Swahili keywords. This project includes a lexer, parser, and interpreter for the SwahiliScript language.

## Features

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes SwahiliScript code into a list of tokens.
- **Parser**: Parses the tokenized code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Interpreter**: Executes SwahiliScript code by evaluating the AST.

To run sample code use `python main.py test.swa`
